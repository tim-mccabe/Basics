    "## Word Embeddings\n",
    "**Word embeddings** (also called word vectors) represent each word numerically in such a way that the vector corresponds to how that word is used or what it means. Vector encodings are learned by considering the context in which the words appear. Words that appear in similar contexts will have similar vectors. For example, vectors for \"leopard\", \"lion\", and \"tiger\" will be close together, while they'll be far away from \"planet\" and \"castle\".\n",
    "\n",
    "These vectors can be used as features for machine learning models. Word vectors will typically improve the performance of your models above bag of words encoding. spaCy provides embeddings learned from a model called Word2Vec. You can access them by loading a large language model like en_core_web_lg. Then they will be available on tokens from the .vector attribute."
