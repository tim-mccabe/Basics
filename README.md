# Machine Learning Basics

## Intro

This repository is meant as a place where I can go back and reference basic syntax and concepts for building out machine laerning models.
All of the models are written in python. The machine learning libraries used are Tensorflow and Scikit-Learn. There are other folders 
that I wanted to add but some of the data files were a little to large to host on GitHub. I saved those notebooks on my Kaggle profile and 
used their servers to run all of my models there. As I learn more machine learning techniques I will continue to update this repository.

## Tasks Performed

The code in these folders pertain to the basic understanding and framework while working with Python to solve machine learning problems. 

Topics include:
  * Basic Data Cleaning
  * Scikit-Learn Library
  * Data Visualization with the Seaborn Library
  * Pandas
  * Feature Engineering
  * Deep Learning
  * SQL
  * Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  * Geospatial Analysis
  * Machine Learning Explainability
  * Game AI and Reinforcement Learning

## Source

Most of the code gathered in this repository was learned from the courses offered by the Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview. I have also added in my own comments and mark down cells in the code to help explain better for other to learn and use as a reference.
