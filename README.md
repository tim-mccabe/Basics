# Machine Learning Basics

This repository is meant as a place where I can go back and reference basic syntax and concepts for building out machine laerning models.
All of the models are written in python. The machine learning libraries used are Tensorflow and Scikit-Learn. There are other folders 
that I wanted to add but some of the data files were a little to large to host on GitHub. I saved those notebooks on my Kaggle profile and 
used their servers to run all of my models there. As I learn more machine learning techniques I will continue to update this repository.
